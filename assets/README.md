# Screenshots for WordPress.org

## Instructions for adding screenshots:

1. Take screenshots of your plugin in action
2. Name them: `screenshot-1.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, `screenshot-3.png`
3. Place them in this `assets` folder
4. Recommended size: 1200x900 pixels (4:3 ratio)

## Screenshot descriptions (from readme.txt):

1. **screenshot-1.png** - Main plugin interface showing autoload data with search functionality and action buttons
2. **screenshot-2.png** - Expert mode warning with modern styling and dismissible notice  
3. **screenshot-3.png** - Plugin navigation tabs with filtering options by mode, plugin, and status

## How to capture:

1. Go to your WordPress admin → Tools → Enhanced Autoload Manager
2. Take screenshot of the main interface (Basic mode)
3. Switch to Expert mode and take screenshot of the warning
4. Take screenshot showing the navigation tabs and filtering options

## Notes:

- WordPress.org will automatically display these screenshots in your plugin listing
- Screenshots should show the plugin's key features clearly
- Use high-quality, clean screenshots without personal data
