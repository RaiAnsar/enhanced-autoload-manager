=0A>>> This prevents your plugin from conflicting with other  plugins or=

Don't try to use two=0A>>> (2) or three (3) letter prefixes anymore. We=

 a prefix. Those are reserved for=0A>>> WordPress  itself. You can use t=
hem inside your classes, but not as=0A>>> stand-alone  function. Please=
 remember, if you're using _n() or __()=0A>>> for translation, that's fi=
ne. We're only  talking about functions=0A>>> you've created for your pl=
ugin, not the core  functions from=0A>>> WordPress. In fact, those core=
 features are why you need  to not use=0A>>> those prefixes in your own=
 plugin! You don't want to break  WordPress=0A>>> for your users. Relate=
d to this, using if (!function_exists('NAME')) {=0A>>> around all your =
 functions and classes sounds like a great idea until=0A>>> you realize=
 the  fatal flaw. If something else has a function with the=0A>>> same n=

exists should  be reserved for shared libraries only. Remember:=0A>>> Go=

 help you and the next person in debugging, as well as prevent=0A>>> con=

 of this plugin.<br>=0A    I have carefully addressed all the issues ide=

irectory Assets</strong>: The assets folder containing screenshots has b=
een completely removed from the plugin zip file. I understand these shou=

once Security</strong>: The flawed nonce validation logic has been corre=
cted. The plugin now properly checks for the presence of GET parameters=
 and requires valid nonce verification when any parameters are present,=
 failing early with wp_die() if the nonce is missing or invalid.<br>=0A=
    3. <strong>Escaping Output</strong>: All translatable strings are no=
w properly escaped using esc_html__() instead of just __(), including th=
e instance on line 509 (now line 517) that was specifically mentioned.<b=
r>=0A    4. <strong>Option Name Prefixing:</strong> All instances of 'to=
tal_autoload_size' have been updated to 'edal_total_autoload_size' throu=
ghout the plugin to prevent conflicts with other plugins.<br>=0A    The=
 updated plugin has been thoroughly tested with:<br>=0A    - WP_DEBUG en=

br><strong>## Nonces and User Permissions Needed for Security</strong><b=
r><br>Please add a nonce check to your input calls ($_POST, $_GET, $REQU=
EST) to prevent unauthorized access. <br><br>If you use <code class=3D"i=
nline-code">wp_ajax_</code>  to trigger submission checks, remember they=
 also need a nonce check. <br><br>=F0=9F=91=AE Checking permissions: Kee=
p in mind, a nonce check alone is not  bulletproof security. Do not rely=
 on nonces for authorization purposes.  When needed, use it together wit=
h <code class=3D"inline-code">current_user_can()</code>  in order to pre=
vent users without the right permissions from accessing things they shou=
ldn't. <br><br>Also make sure that the <strong>nonce logic is correct by=
 making sure it cannot be bypassed</strong>. Checking the nonce with <co=
de class=3D"inline-code">current_user_can()</code>   is great, but mixin=
g it with other checks can make the condition more  complex and, without=
 realising it, bypassable, remember that <strong>anything</strong> can b=
e sent through an input, <strong>don't trust any input</strong>. <br><br=
>Keep performance in mind. Don't check for post submission outside of  f=
unctions. Doing so means that the check will run on every single load  o=
f the plugin, which means that every single person who views any page  o=
n a site using your plugin will be checking for a submission. This will=
  make your code slow and unwieldy for users on any high traffic site, =
 leading to instability and eventually crashes. <br><br>The following li=

  make sure that the nonce logic is correct. It's important to be  cauti=
ous when structuring conditional checks around nonces.<br><pre>enhanced-=

ify_nonce(sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash($_GET['_wpnonce'])), $nonce_act=
ion)) {=0A</pre><br><br><br><strong>Security note</strong>: In the curre=
nt implementation, the nonce  is only verified if all other conditions a=
re met first. This means that  if those other conditions aren=E2=80=99t=
 satisfied, the nonce check is  completely skipped =E2=80=94 effectively=
 making the nonce optional and opening  up a potential security bypass.=
 <br><br>This is particularly risky when you use an <code class=3D"inlin=
e-code">isset()</code>  or <code class=3D"inline-code">!empty()</code> =
 check combined with <code class=3D"inline-code">!wp_verify_nonce()</cod=
e>  in an <strong>AND condition</strong>.  In practice, if the nonce is=
 simply omitted from the request, the  condition won=E2=80=99t be evalua=
ted at all, defeating the purpose of using  nonces to prevent CSRF. <br>=
<br>To enforce nonce validation properly, you should fail early if the n=
once is missing. For example: <br><pre>if ( ! isset( $_POST['enhaauma_no=
nce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['enhaauma_nonce'], 'enhaauma_nonce'=
 ) ) {=0A    wp_die();=0A}=0A// Nonce is present and valid =E2=80=94 con=
tinue execution=0A</pre><br>You can also check this with an AND conditio=
n, in that case the code would look like this: <br><pre>if ( isset( $_PO=
ST['enhaauma_nonce'] ) &amp;&amp; wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['enhaauma_nonc=
e'], 'enhaauma_nonce' ) ) {=0A    // Nonce is present and valid inside t=
his condition.=0A}=0A</pre><br>Example(s) from your plugin: <br><pre>enh=
anced-autoload-manager.php:182 if (isset($_GET['_wpnonce']) &amp;&amp; !=
wp_verify_nonce(sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash($_GET['_wpnonce'])), $non=
ce_action)) {=0A</pre><br><br><br><strong>## Variables and options must=
 be escaped when echo'd</strong><br><br>Much related to sanitizing every=
thing, all variables that are echoed  need to be escaped when they're ec=
hoed, so it can't hijack users or  (worse) admin screens. There are many=
 esc_*() functions you can use to  make sure you don't show people the w=
rong data, as well as some that  will allow you to echo HTML safely. <br=
><br>At this time, we ask you escape <strong>all $-variables, options, a=
nd any sort of generated data when it is being echoed</strong>.  That me=
ans you should not be escaping when you build a variable, but  when you=
 output it at the end. We call this 'escaping late.' <br><br>Besides pro=
tecting yourself from a possible XSS vulnerability, escaping  late makes=
 sure that you're keeping the future you safe. While today  your code ma=
y be only outputted hardcoded content, that may not be true  in the futu=
re. By taking the time to properly escape <strong>when</strong> you echo=
, you prevent a mistake in the future from becoming a critical security=
 issue. <br><br>This remains true of options you've saved to the databas=
e. Even if  you've properly sanitized when you saved, the tools for sani=
tizing and  escaping aren't interchangeable. Sanitizing makes sure it's=
 safe for  processing and storing in the database. Escaping makes it saf=
e to  output. <br><br>Also keep in mind that sometimes a function is ech=
oing when it should  really be returning content instead. This is a comm=
on mistake when it  comes to returning JSON encoded content. Very rarely=
 is that actually  something you should be echoing at all. Echoing is be=
cause it needs to  be on the screen, read by a human. Returning (which i=
s what you would do  with an API) can be json encoded, though remember t=
o <strong>sanitize</strong> when you save to that json object! <br><br>T=
here are a number of options to secure all types of content (html, email=
, etc). Yes, even HTML needs to be properly escaped. <br><br><a href=3D"=
https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/escaping/">https://develop=
er.wordpress.org/apis/security/escaping/</a><br><br>Remember: You must u=
se the most appropriate functions for the context.  There is pretty much=
 an option for everything you could echo. Even  echoing HTML safely. <br=

lugin Check</a>.<br><br><br><strong>## Generic function/class/define/nam=
espace/option names</strong><br><br>All plugins must have unique functio=
n names, namespaces, defines, class  and option names. This prevents you=
r plugin from conflicting with other  plugins or themes. We need you to=
 update your plugin to use more unique  and distinct names. <br><br>A go=
od way to do this is with a prefix. For example, if your plugin is  call=
ed "Enhanced Autoload Manager" then you could use names like these: <br>=
<ul><li>function enhaauma_save_post(){ ... }<br></li><li>class ENHAAUMA_=
Admin { ... }<br></li><li>update_option( 'enhaauma_options', $options );=
<br></li><li>register_setting( 'enhaauma_settings', 'enhaauma_user_id',=
 ... );<br></li><li>define( 'ENHAAUMA_PLUGIN_DIR', plugin_dir_path( __FI=
LE__ ) );<br></li><li>global $enhaauma_options;<br></li><li>add_action('=
wp_ajax_enhaauma_save_data', ... );<br></li><li>namespace raiansar\enhan=
cedautoloadmanager;<br></li></ul><br><i>Disclaimer: These are just examp=
les that may have been self-generated  from your plugin name, we trust y=
ou can find better options. If you  have a good alternative, please use=
 it instead, this is just an example.</i><br><br>Don't try to use two (2=
) or three (3) letter prefixes anymore. We host  nearly 100-thousand plu=
gins on WordPress.org alone. There are tens of  thousands more outside o=
ur servers. Believe us, you=E2=80=99re going to run into  conflicts. <br=
><br>You also need to avoid the use of __ (double underscores), wp_ , or=
 _  (single underscore) as a prefix. Those are reserved for WordPress  i=
tself. You can use them inside your classes, but not as stand-alone  fun=
ction. <br><br>Please remember, if you're using _n() or __() for transla=
tion, that's fine. We're <strong>only</strong>  talking about functions=
 you've created for your plugin, not the core  functions from WordPress.=
 In fact, those core features are why you need  to not use those prefixe=
s in your own plugin! You don't want to break  WordPress for your users.=
 <br><br>Related to this, using if (!function_exists('NAME')) { around a=
ll your  functions and classes sounds like a great idea until you realiz=
e the  fatal flaw. If something else has a function with the same name a=
nd  their code loads first, your plugin will break. Using if-exists shou=
ld  be reserved for shared libraries only. <br><br>Remember: Good prefix=
 names are unique and distinct to your plugin. This  will help you and t=
he next person in debugging, as well as prevent  conflicts. <br><br>Anal=
ysis result: <br><pre># This plugin is using the prefix "edal" for 12 el=
ement(s).=0A=0A# Looks like there are elements not using common prefixes=

er.php:720 update_option('total_autoload_size', floatval($settings['tota=
l_autoload_size']));=0A</pre><br><br><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>Opti=
ons and Transients must be prefixed</strong>. <br><br>This is really imp=
ortant because the options are stored in a shared  location and under th=
e name you have set. If two plugins use the same  name for options, they=
 will find an interesting conflict when trying to  read information intr=
oduced by the other plugin. <br><br>Also, once your plugin has active us=
ers, changing the name of an option  is going to be really tricky, so le=
t's make it robust from the very  beginning. <br><br>Example(s) from you=
